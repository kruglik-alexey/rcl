react-redux connected component rerender when no store changes and ownProps are shallow equal
arrays and shallow equal

With an event like onToggle, why is Sidebar even diffing it? There are only two reasons to include a prop in the shouldComponentUpdate diff:
You use the prop to render.
You use the prop to perform a side-effect in componentWillReceiveProps, componentDidUpdate, or componentWillUpdate.
Most on<whatever> props do not meet either of these requirements.

measure time in render
measure time in mapStateToPros etc
measure ratio of shouldComponentUpdate false results

support arrays wo keys (or not?)
